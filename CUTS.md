# Explicit Feature Cuts

The following features were intentionally **not built** due to time constraints.

These were conscious decisions, not omissions.

## Why These Were Cut
- Low signal relative to time cost
- Would distract from core correctness
- Not required to demonstrate senior judgment

All cuts are reversible with clear extension points.
